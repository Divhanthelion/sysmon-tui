Example:\n\n```\ntrait Foo {\n    fn bar(&self);\n}\n\n// we implement the trait on the i32 type\nimpl Foo for i32 {\n    fn bar(&self) {}\n}\n\nfn some_func<T: Foo>(foo: T) {\n    foo.bar(); // we can now use this method since i32 implements the\n               // Foo trait\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    some_func(5i32); // ok!\n}\n```\n\nOr in a generic context, an erroneous code example would look like:\n\n```compile_fail,E0277\nfn some_func<T>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo); // error: the trait `core::fmt::Debug` is not\n                           //        implemented for the type `T`\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // We now call the method with the i32 type,\n    // which *does* implement the Debug trait.\n    some_func(5i32);\n}\n```\n\nNote that the error here is in the definition of the generic function. Although\nwe only call it with a parameter that does implement `Debug`, the compiler\nstill rejects the function. It must work with all possible input types. In\norder to make this example compile, we need to restrict the generic type we're\naccepting:\n\n```\nuse std::fmt;\n\n// Restrict the input type to types that implement Debug.\nfn some_func<T: fmt::Debug>(foo: T) {\n    println!(\"{:?}\", foo);\n}\n\nfn main() {\n    // Calling the method is still fine, as i32 implements Debug.\n    some_func(5i32);\n\n    // This would fail to compile now:\n    // struct WithoutDebug;\n    // some_func(WithoutDebug);\n}\n```\n\nRust only looks at the signature of the called function, as such it must\nalready specify all requirements that will be used for every type parameter.\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":3173,"byte_end":3184,"line_start":99,"line_end":99,"column_start":36,"column_end":47,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        impl std::error::Error for SysmonError {}","highlight_start":36,"highlight_end":47}],"label":"unsatisfied trait bound","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `SysmonError`","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"src/main.rs","byte_start":3030,"byte_end":3050,"line_start":94,"line_end":94,"column_start":9,"column_end":29,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        pub enum SysmonError {","highlight_start":9,"highlight_end":29}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"required by a bound in `std::error::Error`","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[{"file_name":"/rustc/ded5c06cf21d2b93bffd5d884aa6e96934ee4234/library/core/src/error.rs","byte_start":2024,"byte_end":2056,"line_start":59,"line_end":59,"column_start":1,"column_end":33,"is_primary":true,"text":[],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0277]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: `SysmonError` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`\u001b[0m\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/main.rs:99:36\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m99\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         impl std::error::Error for SysmonError {}\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                                    \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91munsatisfied trait bound\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: the trait `std::fmt::Display` is not implemented for `SysmonError`\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0msrc/main.rs:94:9\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m94\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         pub enum SysmonError {\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         \u001b[1m\u001b[96m^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[92mnote\u001b[0m: required by a bound in `std::error::Error`\n  \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0m/rustc/ded5c06cf21d2b93bffd5d884aa6e96934ee4234/library/core/src/error.rs:59:1\n\n"}
